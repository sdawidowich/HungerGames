# HungerGames
Currently a work in progress Hunger Games Simulator made in C++.

First thing that appears is the menu. You can select to start a new game, load a game, or quit the program. When you start a new game, you can choose to change some settings like the tribute roster and simulation type. 

Once all the settings are configured to your liking, you can select continue and the simulation will start. The program will print out every event made by a character during a day then display all the deaths that day. Once the simulation ends, the program will take the user back to the menu.
